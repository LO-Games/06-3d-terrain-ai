# Unity week 6: Three-dimensional scene-building and navigation

## Our changes
We chose 1. Developing the existing scene (from homework 1).
We made stairs leading to a bright room divided into a bedroom and bathroom.
In addition, we chose player development from the guide and chose 1. movement (from homework 2).
We chose sections A and B in which the player should be given the option to jump and run.
We added a character with appropriate animations for walking, running and jumping.
We added an original change where the player must collect a card to open the door in the main building.
